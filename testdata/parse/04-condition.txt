Test that different kinds of conditions are parseable.

Conditions which have attribute/value matches but no bound variable parse,
but Soar prints a warning:
 Warning: On the LHS of production xyz, identifier <s*1>
 is not connected to any goal or impasse.
The two that say "Crashes Soar" are related to this bug:
