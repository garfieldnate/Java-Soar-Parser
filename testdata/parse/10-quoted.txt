--- prod

=== slash escaping
this should not parse because the slash before the first bar is escaped, so that the extra bar is not escaped
--- prod
sp {escaped
    (state <s> ^foo |a slash \\||)
--> (<s> ^foo bar)
}
--- parses: false

=== slash not used as an escape
--- prod
sp {not-escaped
    (state <s> ^foo |a slash \s was here|)
--> (<s> ^foo bar)
}
--- parses: true
