=== no space
Soar takes '<<a' to be a string, then is baffled by '>>'.
--- prod
sp {no-space
    (state <s> ^foo <<a b >>)
--> (<s> ^foo bar)
}
--- parses: false

=== no space
Soar takes 'b>>' to be a string, and so cannot finish the disjunction.
--- prod
sp {no-space
    (state <s> ^foo << b>>)
--> (<s> ^foo bar)
}
